# London Bike Sharing Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis of the London Bike Sharing dataset. The goal of this project is to understand the trends and patterns in bike sharing in London, and to identify factors that may affect bike rental demand.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about bike rentals in London. The columns in the dataset represent the following:

- `timestamp`: The date and time when the data was recorded.
- `count`: The number of bikes rented at that particular timestamp.
- `c_temp`: The temperature in Celsius at that particular timestamp.
- `f_temp`: The temperature Feels like at that particular timestamp.
- `humidity`: The humidity level at that particular timestamp.
- `wind_speed`: The wind speed at that particular timestamp.
- `weather_code`: A code representing the weather condition at that particular timestamp.{1:Clear,2:scattered Clouds,3:Broken clouds,4:Cloudy,7:Rain,10:Rain with thunderstorm,26:snowfall,94:Freezing Fog}
- `is_holiday`: A binary value indicating whether the day is a holiday or not (1 for holiday, 0 for non-holiday).
- `is_weekend`: A binary value indicating whether the day is a weekend or not (1 for weekend, 0 for non-weekend).
- `season`: A value representing the season at that particular timestamp {0 : Spring , 1 : Summer , 2 : Autumn , 3 : Winter}.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I've performed exploratory data analysis on the London Bike Sharing dataset to understand the trends and patterns in bike sharing in London. I analyzed the data to identify factors that may affect bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, holidays, weekends, and seasons.

Through this analysis, I was able to gain insights into how these factors may influence bike rental demand in London. These insights can be useful for bike sharing companies and city planners to make informed decisions about bike sharing infrastructure and services.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provided a comprehensive analysis of the London Bike Sharing dataset. Through the Exploratory Data Analysis, I was able to identify trends and patterns in bike sharing in London and gain insights into factors that may affect bike rental demand. I've identified that People in London tend to use the bike sharing system more during the summer months, with the highest usage in July and August. The lowest usage is in December and January. This is likely due to the cold weather in the winter months. Moreover the bike sharing system is used more during the weekdays than the weekends. This is likely due to the fact that people use the bike sharing system to commute to work or school. The bike sharing system is used more during the morning and evening rush hours, which is also likely due to the fact that people use the bike sharing system to commute to work or school. Also the people in London rent the bike in Clear , Cloudy and Misty weather.
